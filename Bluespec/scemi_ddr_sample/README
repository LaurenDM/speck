This example project writes/reads FPGA DRAM via SceMi. 

For writes:
* addresses start at 0 and counts up on each data packet received from SceMi
* data written is 32-bit, zero extended to 512-bit
* data content is just the address value

For reads:
* a request is sent to start reading from address 0 up to len
* callback function prints the 512-bit response truncated to 32-bit

Bug fixed: 

* On DRAM reads, responses are dropped (as opposed to blocked) if the receiver is
  not ready to receive data.  The fix is to limit the number of outstanding read
  requests and use a large (32 deep) response FIFO to guarantee data can always
  be received. 

  This fix is implemented in include/DDR3OutstandingLimit.bsv
